      <h2 id="A">The Beginning of iKON</h1>

      <p> Anyone who knows the K-Pop industry knows it to be cutthroat and unforgiving, and iKON, a once 7 member group is no stranger to it. 
      Debuting on September 15, 2014 under YG Entertainment, the idol boy group consists of <strong>Jay</strong>(Kim Jinhwan), <strong>Song</strong>(Song YoonHyung),
      <strong>Bobby</strong>(Kim JiWon), <strong>DK</strong>(Kim DongHyuk), <strong>Ju-ne</strong>(Koo JunHoe), <strong>Chan</strong>(Jung ChanWoo), and former member <strong>B.I.</strong>(Kim Hanbin). </p>

      <!--describes how they came to be iKON-->
      <p>Before debuting and becoming iKON, Yang Hyunsuk, YG's CEO at the time, put them through two survival shows to fight for their debut. They were 
        introduced as Team B to the public on the first show in 2013, "WIN: Who is next", and although they had lots of popularity already from public trainee 
        dance and vocal practices, this show gained them even more fans. Fighting through lots of tears and desperation to debut after many years of training as 
        young teenagers, they narrowly lost to Team A, who is currently known as "Winner". Yang Hyunsuk told them that this loss would cost them their debut 
        together and they had little hope of staying as one team, but they continued training despite this detour in hopes that they could debut whether together or not. 
        Yang HyunSuk gave them hope later by suddenly deciding to hold another survival show called "Mix and Match" in 2014, and to their dismay, he surprised 
        them by adding other trainees to increase the pressure and the competition. Again, through sleepless and stressful days of showing off their rap, dance, and 
        vocal skills, the 7 members who are in the picture above were chosen to debut. Afterwards, fans eagerly awaited for their debut in 2015 to show off their hard work.</p>

    <!--describes the sudden departure of an iKON member-->
    <div>
      <h2 id="C">An Unexpected Departure</h1>
      
      <p>iKON became a 6 member group in 2019 when member B.I.(Kim Hanbin) was involved in a scandal where he allegedly tried to obtain illegal drugs in Korea in 2016 citing
      that he was going through a tough and painful time as the reason. The girl who "exposed" the scandal had even gained a reputation for trying to disrupt the careers of idols.
      In the end, although he gave an apology taking responsibility for his actions, he stated that he did not end up going through with the purchase because he was fearful 
      and scared to take the drugs and that he was sorry for disappointing fans. The police even investigated the situation, but found nothing that needed prosecution and 
      B.I. was labeled as innocent. Hanbin left iKON to preserve the reputation of the group; however, many speculate that Yang HyunSuk, the CEO at the time, kicked him out.
      Of course this is all speculation, and fans will never the truth that occurred behind the scenes and will have to take the company and his word as truth for now.</p>
      
      <p>Despite the situation, many fans supported and forgave him, as mental health is a taboo topic in Korean society, especially for idols, and created a petition on 
      <a href="https://www.change.org/p/yg-entertainment-hanbin-shouldn-t-have-to-leave-ikon" target="_blank">Change.org</a> to
      try to convince YG Entertainment to bring him back. The petition garnered over 850,000 signatures globally but did not manage to bring B.I. back to the group he spent 
      years training for, but it did show to him that fans cared for his wellbeing and will wait for his return to the industry, as his excellent composing, producing, 
      dancing, singing, rapping, and leadership skills are not skills to be disregarded; his award for Songwriter of the Year in 2018 at the 10th Melon Music Awards is evidence of this.</p>
      
      <p> As of May 2021, B.I has announced that he will be returning to music will an expected album release on June 01, 2021. The album includes 12 songs and all teasers and album spoilers
        are being released onto the "131 Label" official YouTube channel. </p>
