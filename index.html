      <h1 id="A">The Beginning of iKON</h1>
      <p> Anyone who knows the K-Pop industry knows it to be cutthroat and unforgiving, and iKON, a once 7 member group is no stranger to it.<br> 
      Debuting on September 15, 2014 under YG Entertainment, the idol boy group consists of <em>Jay</em>(Kim Jinhwan), <em>Song</em>(Song YoonHyung), <br> 
      <em>Bobby</em>(Kim JiWon), <em>DK</em>(Kim DongHyuk), <em>Ju-ne</em>(Koo JunHoe), <em>Chan</em>(Jung ChanWoo), and Former member <em>B.I.</em>(Kim Hanbin). </p>

      <p>Before debuting and becoming iKON, Yang Hyunsuk, YG's CEO at the time, put them through two survival shows to fight for their debut. They were <br>
        introduced as Team B to the public on the first show in 2013, "WIN: Who is next", and although they had lots of popularity already from public trainee <br>
        dance and vocal practices, this show gained them even more fans. Fighting through lots of tears and desperation to debut after many years of training as <br>
        young teenagers, they narrowly lost to Team A, who is currently known as "Winner". Yang Hyunsuk told them that this loss would cost them their debut <br>
        together and they had little hope of staying together, and they continued training despite this detour in hopes that they could debut even if they were <br>
        separated. Yang HyunSuk answered their prayers by suddenly deciding to hold another survival show called "Mix and Match" in 2014, and he surprised <br>
        them by adding other trainees to their dismay to up the competition. Again, through sleepless and stressfull days of showing off their rap, dance, and <br>
        vocal skills, the 7 members who are in the picture above were chosen to debut. Fans eagerly awaited for their debut in 2015 to show off their hard work.</p>
